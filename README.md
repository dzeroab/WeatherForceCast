4. API Answer:
    - I think the backend team should not apply the changes to the existing endpoint because if
    we do, it will impact the old app version, so, the old app version may not display correctly
    - I would suggest that the backend team will introduce the new endpoint version and they can do
    whatever they like
    For example: the old endpoint: GET api/endpoint and the new one can be like GET api/v2/endpoint
    so, the old app version can use the old one, the new version will use the v2 endpoint
